The origin of the name is uncertain. Literal translation of the name from Arabic is 'Father of the Deer', which possibly refers to the few gazelles that inhabit the emirate. The area had a lot of dhibaa [deer (plural)], and was nicknamed after that. An old story tells about a man who used to chase deer [dhabi (deer - singular)] and was named the 'father' of the animal. Abu Dhabi's original name was Milh 'salt', possibly referring to the salty water of the Persian Gulf, or the ancient salt marshes that surround the city.
